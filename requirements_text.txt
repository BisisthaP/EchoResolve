Project: EchoResolve - AI-Powered Voice Assistant for Real-Time Customer Service Intervention

Target Pain Points & Corresponding Features:

Pain Point: Delayed Resolution of Urgent Customer Requests (e.g., address changes, cancellations) leading to customer frustration, potential order loss, and negative brand perception.

Feature: Automated Order Modification (Address/Cancel):
Description: Allows customers to verbally request and complete critical changes (like delivery address updates or order cancellations) in real-time, provided the order hasn't yet passed a defined fulfillment threshold.
AI/Tech: Real-time integration with Order Management System (OMS), state management to check order status, robust NLU to parse modification requests.
Pain Point: Inconvenient and Slow Process for Returns/Exchanges for Damaged or Incorrect Items, leading to customer dissatisfaction and potential churn.

Feature: Voice-Initiated Returns & Exchange Workflow:
Description: Guides customers through the initial steps of initiating a return or exchange due to damaged/incorrect items. This includes verifying order details, confirming the issue, and initiating the process by generating a return label and instructions.
AI/Tech: NLU to understand the reason for return, integration with Returns Management System (RMS), potential for AI-powered image/damage description analysis (simulated), and integration with email/SMS for label delivery.
Pain Point: Lost Sales Opportunities due to inability to quickly check real-time product availability (online and in-store) or obtain essential product information.

Feature: Real-time Product Information & Store Inventory Lookup:
Description: Enables customers to verbally inquire about product details (features, specs), online stock availability, and, crucially, real-time inventory levels at specific physical store locations.
AI/Tech: Integration with Inventory Management System (IMS) and potentially Point-of-Sale (POS) data (simulated), NLU for parsing product queries and location information.
Pain Point: High Operational Costs of Customer Support and Inability to Scale Efficiently during peak times or for common inquiries.

Feature: Intelligent Triage & Self-Service Resolution:
Description: Accurately identifies the customer's intent and resolves common, repetitive queries (e.g., "Where is my order?", "What is your return policy?") without human intervention. For complex issues, it accurately routes the customer to the appropriate human agent with full conversational context.
AI/Tech: Advanced NLU for intent recognition, robust FAQ/knowledge base integration, conversational AI for self-service, sophisticated escalation logic.
Pain Point: Customer Frustration stemming from impersonal or generic automated responses, particularly during stressful situations.

Feature: Emotional Intelligence & Contextual Awareness:
Description: Analyzes the tone and sentiment in the customer's voice to detect urgency or frustration, enabling more empathetic responses. It also maintains conversational context across interactions with the same customer.
AI/Tech: Sentiment analysis algorithms, stateful dialogue management.
Pain Point: Lack of Personalized Service leading to missed opportunities for upselling/cross-selling or identifying at-risk customers.

Feature: CRM Integration for Personalized Interactions & Customer Health Scoring (Simulated):
Description: Accesses customer history from CRM to personalize responses (e.g., acknowledging past purchases, offering relevant product suggestions) and allows for simulated "customer health scoring" to flag high-value or at-risk customers for prioritized handling or proactive outreach.
AI/Tech: CRM integration (simulated), data analysis for personalized recommendations, basic customer segmentation logic.
